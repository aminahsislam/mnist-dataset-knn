ML - MNIST K-NN classification
In this project, we use the MNIST dataset provided by scikit-learn library.

MNIST is a computer vision dataset that consists of handwritten digits and labels for each image (which tells which digit it is)

k-NN classifier will be applied to the image dataset in order to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST subset.

The training-test ratio will vary and the training and testing accuracy will be plotted for each training-test ratio
